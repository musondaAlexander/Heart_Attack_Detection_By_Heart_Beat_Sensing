# Heart_Attack_Detection_By_Heart_Beat_Sensing
Welcome to Project Heart_Attack_Detection_By_Heart_Beat_Sensing!

This project aims to develop a system that can accurately detect the occurrence of a heart attack through heart beat sensing. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze heart rate and rhythm data collected from a wearable device, and provides real-time feedback to the user.

To use this system, you will need to have a compatible heart rate monitoring device and install the required software on your computer or mobile device. The software will guide you through the process of connecting your device and configuring the settings for data collection and analysis.

Please note that this system is not intended to replace medical advice or diagnosis from a qualified healthcare professional. It is designed to provide additional monitoring and support for individuals who may be at risk of a heart attack or who have a history of cardiovascular disease.

We hope that this project will be useful for improving early detection and prevention of heart attacks, and we welcome any feedback or contributions from the community.
This Repo is for an Arduino project that is used to Create a Heart Detection System that monitors the Heart Rate and sends an alarm to the 
Medical Pofession who is monitoring the patients Vitals. 
it also has a buzzer that goes off when unuasal heart Beat has been detetcted.
